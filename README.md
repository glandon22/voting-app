This is a project from Free Code Camp's backend developer certification. Specifications for the project can be found here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-voting-app.

This app is built with Bootstrap, NodeJS + Express, MongoDB, and EJS. The app functions both on a laptop/desktop as well as tablets/mobiles. 

Users are able to create an account, which will be stored in a MongoDB collection once the password information has been encrypted. Usernames are stored as plain text. Users are able to log in and out within the application. 

In the app, a registered user can create a poll. You do not need to be registered to vote in a poll. All users are restricted to voting once per poll. Voting counts are tracked either by IP address or username. Users will be able to see which poll they have created, and can delete those polls if they want to.

Users can choose from options that are already in a poll, or can create a custom option. The charts are created using ChartJS.
